\section{Numerical solutions}
In this section we numerically solve the linear stability problem
corresponding to Eq. \ref{lin_mass}---\ref{lin_energy}. 
We relax the thin-disk, low-frequency and nearly-Keplerian
approximations used in the analytical discussion above, and  
use the full expressions of $\rho$, $\Omega$ and
$\kappa$ given in \S\ref{eqm}. We also restore $\hat{g}_c=1$ to
account for the background radial disk structure.  

%, so that we may consistently consider vertical domains up to
%$z\sim r$.   

We solve the linear problem by expanding the
perturbations in Chebyshev polynomials $T_l$ up to $l=512$
and discretizing the equations on a grid with
$z\in[-\zmax,\zmax]$. At the vertical boundaries we impose a free
surface, 
\begin{align}
  \Delta P \equiv \delta P + \bm{\xi}\cdot\nabla P= 0 \quad \text{at } z=\pm\zmax,
\end{align}
where $\bm{\xi}$ is the Lagrangian displacement. This boundary
condition is convenient for numerical implementation since it conforms
to a standard eigenvalue problem. The above discretization procedure
converts the linear system of differential equations to a set of 
algebraic equations, for which we use matrix routines in the LAPACK
package to solve.

\subsection{VSI in a locally isothermal, neutrally stratified disk}\label{vertiso_pertiso} 
% disk model is a nearly-vertically
% isothermal disk with $\Gamma=1.011$, $p=-1.5$, $q=-1$,
% $\epsilon=0.1$. 
We first calculate the VSI in a nearly vertcally isothermal, neutrally
straitified disk ($N_z^2\equiv0$) by setting
$\gamma=\Gamma=1.011$ and $\beta=10^{-3}$. Other disk parameters are 
$(p,q,\epsilon)=(-1.5,-1,0.1)$ and the vertical domain is $\zmax =
5\epsilon r$. This setup is similar to that adopted in
\cite{mcnally14}, who calculated the VSI in vertically isothermal
disks subject to isothermal perturbations ($\Gamma=\gamma=1$).  This
allows us to test our numerical code.  

%behaviour as func of kx 

Fig. \ref{iso_eigen_kx} compares the numerically-obtained eigenvalues
for the fundamental mode and that calculated from 
Eq. \ref{sig2_iso} (with $L=1$). There is good agreement for 
$\khat\gtrsim10$. The match worsens for smaller $\khat$ because the 
the low-frequency approximation used to obtain Eq. \ref{sig2_iso} 
is no longer valid, as $|\omega|$ is not small compared to $\Omega_k$
for $\khat\lesssim 10$.  

% This means
% that our analytic results should only be applied to perturbations with
% $\khat\gg 1$, i.e. small radial-lengthscales.

    (analytically).  
    \label{iso_eigen_kx} 
  }
\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{lowfreq_eigenfunc} compares the fundamental VSI eigenfunction
$W$ for $\khat=1$ and $\khat=20\pi$. The latter value, corresponding
to $k_x= 200\pi/r$, was used by \cite{mcnally14}. We find $W$ is
similar for all $\khat\gtrsim10$ and is proportional to $z$, as
expected for the fundamental mode according to explicit solutions
developed in \S\ref{iso_poly}.  

However, for $\khat\lesssim 10$, e.g. $\khat=1$ in 
Fig. \ref{lowfreq_eigenfunc}, the perturbation magnitude near the
boundaries begin to dominate. For even smaller $\khat\lesssim 1$ (not
shown) we find the perturbation is almost entirely concentrated at the
boundaries. Our radially-local approximation is not valid for 
these small wavenumber perturbations and we do not consider such modes
further.

    (imaginary) parts of $W$ are plotted as solid (dotted) lines. 
    \label{lowfreq_eigenfunc}
  }
\end{figure}

In Fig. \ref{lowfreq_eigen} we plot the eigenvalues 
$\sigma = \omega + \ii\nu$ found for $\khat=20\pi$. This plot is
similar to Fig. 3 in \cite{mcnally14}. The fundamental
VSI mode, with one node in $W$, has the smallest $|\sigma|$. The
eigenvalue calculated from Eq. \ref{sig2_iso} with $L=1$ and the 
numerically-obtained value are  
\begin{align*}
  (\omega,\nu) = (-0.3053,0.2606)\epsilon\Omega_k &\quad \text{(from
    Eq. \ref{sig2_iso})},\\
  (\omega,\nu) = (-0.3010,0.2575) \epsilon \Omega_k &\quad \text{(numerical)}.
\end{align*}
This agreement is surpsingly good given the number of approximations
used to obtain Eq. \ref{sig2_iso}, which also imposes a different
boundary condition to that in the numerical calculation. These values
are also close to that found by \cite{mcnally14}. The eigenfrequency
is not sensitive to the vertical boundary condition because the
expression for $\sigma$, given by Eq. \ref{integral_relation1},
involve integrands with $\rho$ as the   weight function, which rapidly
decays away from the midplane.

    $\beta=10^{-3}$. \label{lowfreq_eigen}

\subsection{Effect of thermal relaxation}
We now consider stably stratified disks ($\gamma > \Gamma$) with
thermal relaxation. Here, we use a slightly  
different disk model with $\epsilon=0.05$ and $\gamma=1.4$, as 
adopted in simulations performed by \cite{nelson13}. Other parameters 
are unchanged from the previous section.  

Fig. \ref{bcrit_compare1} shows the growth rate $\nu$ of the
fundamental VSI as a function of $\beta$ for $\khat\in[1,10^2]$. We
also plot the critical thermal relaxation timescale
$\beta_\mathrm{crit}$ given by Eq. \ref{iso_vsi_cond}. For the present
disk parameters $\beta_\mathrm{crit}=0.125$.   

For $5\lesssim\khat\lesssim30$, we find $\beta_\mathrm{crit}$ provides an
accurate prediction of the upper limit to the thermal relaxation 
timescale for  the fundamental mode. For smaller $\khat$,
$\beta<\beta_\mathrm{crit}$ is a sufficient condition for
instability. For larger $\khat$, we find $\nu$ does not reach zero but
rapidly decreases as $\beta$ approaches and increases beyond
$\beta_\mathrm{crit}$. In the latter case we find the perturbation is
concentrated at the vertical boundaries, which may play a role not
accounted by our analytical discussion. 

Fig. \ref{bcrit_compare1} shows that 
$\beta_\mathrm{crit}$ is a good indication for the maximum
thermal relaxation timescale to permit the fundamental VSI. For
$\beta\lesssim O(10^{-2})$, growth rates are insensitive to thermal
relaxation. For this disk model, \citeauthor{nelson13}
found a thermal relaxation timescale of $\beta\gtrsim 0.6$ stabilized
the VSI in non-linear hydrodynamic simulations. This is consistent
with our results.

% Fig. \ref{relax_growth_num} also confirms our analytical discussion that

% This occurs at $\khat= O(10)$ for the current disk model.

We visualize the effect of thermal relaxation in 
Fig. \ref{relax_eigenW_num} by comparing the eigenfunction $W$ for
$\beta=0.01$ and $\beta=0.1$. The latter value is close to the
critical value beyond which the fundamental VSI is stabilized
(\S\ref{iso_vsi_beta_crit}). Increasing $\beta$ 
restricts  the region in which $W\sim z$ closer to the midplane, with
oscillatory behavior emerging at the boundaries, where buoyancy first
becomes important. Finite thermal relaxation increases $|W|$ near the
vertical boundaries relative to that about the midplane, but
perturbations near the disk surface is unlikely important in practice
because the disk atmosphere contains little mass. 

% We also find this trend for fixed $\beta$ but
% increasing 
% $\khat$.

\subsection{Critical thermal relaxation timescale}
% may need to explain why choose k=10
% bcrit independent of k for k>>1 
% for some parameter regimes (e.g. large q, large epsilon) 
% behavior at larger kx and finite bcool not understood. 
We test the dependence of the critical thermal relaxation timescale 
$\beta_\mathrm{crit}$ for the fundamental VSI on disk parameters
(Eq. \ref{iso_vsi_cond}).  We use the previous case study as a
reference point and vary $q\in[-0.2,-1.2]$, 
$\gamma\in[1.2,2.0]$, and $\epsilon\in[0.02,0.1]$
separately. Here, we use a wavenumber $\khat=10$, for which we
find growth rates reach zero for the range of disk parameters
considered, so that a numerical $\beta_\mathrm{crit}$ can be defined precisely. 

The numerically-obtained $\beta_\mathrm{crit}$ is shown in
Fig. \ref{bcrit_compare} in comparison with Eq. \ref{iso_vsi_cond}.
Our numerical results generally agree with Eq. \ref{iso_vsi_cond}. The
agreement improves with decreasing  $|q|$,  $\epsilon$ and increasing
$\gamma$, i.e. weaker instability, although there is a noticeable difference
as $\gamma\to1$ because the derivation of $\beta_\mathrm{crit}$
assumed $\gamma>1$.   

Fig. \ref{bcrit_compare}, together with the previous section
(Fig. \ref{bcrit_compare1}), shows that $\beta_\mathrm{crit}$ as given
by Eq. \ref{iso_vsi_cond} gives a measure of the characteristic
thermal timescale below which perturbations are effectively isothermal
so that the fundamental VSI operates. 

% From the previous section (Fig. \ref{relax_eigenW_num}) we
% expect that for other wavenumbers,  still gives a characteristic
% thermal timescale below which the perturbations are effectively
% isothermal.

\subsection{Vertically non-isothermal disks} 
We briefly consider vertically non-isothermal disks with 
$\Gamma=1.4$ and $(p,q,\epsilon)=(0,-1,0.05)$ as simulated in
\cite{nelson13}. In this case we set $\zmax\simeq2.2\epsilon r$, which
is close to the zero-density surface.      

Fig. \ref{gcorr_compare_vnoniso} plots the fundamental VSI growth
rates as a function of $\beta$ for $\gamma\in[1.4,2.5]$. For
comparison with \cite{nelson13} we consider 
$\beta\in[10^{-2},10^2]$. In agreement with \citeauthor{nelson13}, in
the neutrally-stratified case $\gamma=\Gamma$ the disk is unstable
even for $\beta\gg 1$. (Note that in the adiabatic limit
$\beta\to\infty$ this disk can be unstable according to the
Solberg-Hoiland criterion, Eq. \ref{solberg2}.) 

For $\gamma>\Gamma$, i.e. stably stratified disks,
Fig. \ref{gcorr_compare_vnoniso} shows that introducing finite thermal
relaxation rapidly stabilizes the fundamental VSI mode. This is
similar to that observed for nearly vertically isothermal disks
(Fig. \ref{bcrit_compare1}). For $\gamma=1.7,\,2.0,\,2.5$, growth
rates reach zero for  $\beta\simeq0.17,\,0.083,\,0.045$, respectively.
Interestingly, these values are equal to
$\epsilon|q|/(\gamma-\Gamma)$. This suggests that the critial thermal
relaxation timescale for vertically non-isothermal disks can also be
estimated by Eq. \ref{iso_vsi_cond} but with $\gamma-1$ replaced by
$\gamma-\Gamma$.

    stratified for $\gamma=1.4$ and stably stratified for
    $\gamma>1.4$. Other disk parameters are
    $(p,q,\epsilon)=(0,-1,0.05)$ and the perturbation wavenumber is
    $\khat=30$.

\end{figure}












% \subsection{VSI in a stably stratified disk}
% We demonstrate the (strong) stabilizing effect of a  
% positive vertical entropy gradient ($N_z^2\geq0$) by setting $\gamma=2$.  
% Since we expect the perturbations to decay rapidly
% away from the midplane (see \S\ref{analytic_adia}), we consider a
% smaller domain with $\zmax = 2\epsilon r$. 
% Other disk and perturbation parameters are the same as in
% \S\ref{vertiso_pertiso}.    

% Fig. \ref{lowfreq_eigen_adia} show the eigenvalues for this
% problem. The growth rates are much smaller than
% those in the previous section. The fundamental VSI mode is that with
% $\mathrm{max}\nu$. Its expected and numerically-calculated growth
% rates compares well, with 
% \begin{align*}
%   \nu = 0.03751 \epsilon \Omega_k &\quad \text{(from
%     Eq. \ref{gam2_growth_rate})},\\
%   \nu = 0.03672 \epsilon \Omega_k &\quad \text{(numerical)}.
% \end{align*}
% The fundamental mode is plotted in Fig. \ref{lowfreq_eigenfunc_adia},
% and clearly show that perturbations are rapidly stabilized away from
% the midplane. For the adopted disk and perturbation parameters,
% Eq. \ref{gam2_alpha} gives $\real{\alpha}\simeq - 43.8$, corresponding
% to a characteristic decay length scale of $\sqrt{2/|\alpha|}\epsilon r\simeq 0.2\epsilon r$,
% which is consistent with that observed in  Fig. \ref{lowfreq_eigenfunc_adia}. 

% This decay lengthscale is rougly the height within which
% vertical shear is larger than the buoyancy frequency squared. That is,
% \begin{align*}
% \left|r\frac{d\Omega^2}{dz}\right|\gtrsim N_z^2
% \end{align*}
% for
% \begin{align*}
%   \left|\frac{z}{\epsilon r}\right| \lesssim \frac{\epsilon|q|\gamma}{\gamma-1},
% \end{align*}
% in a thin, vertically isothermal disk. This evaluates to $|z|\lesssim
% 0.2\epsilon r$ for the current disk model, consistent with
% Fig. \ref{lowfreq_eigenfunc_adia}. 

% Furthermore, the growth rate to should be no larger than the
% maximum vertical shear available within this decay lengthscale. Using 
% Eq. \ref{max_growth} as a rough guide, 
% \begin{align}
%   \frac{\nu}{\epsilon\Omega_k}<\frac{\epsilon |q|^2\gamma}{2(\gamma-1)},
% \end{align}
% or $\nu< 0.1\epsilon\Omega_k$ in our disk model,
% consistent with numerical results.

% \end{figure}

% Although a positive vertical entropy gradient is stabilizing, we note
% that $N_z^2\propto z^2$  while vertical shear $rd\Omega^2/dz\propto
% z$, so that there is always a region sufficiently close to the
% midplane in which vertical shear dominates over bouyancy and the VSI
% can operate. However, the growth rates are small and the instability
% only affects the regions close the midplane. These modes may not be
% important in practice.  


% \subsection{Other adiabatic indices}
% To see the transition from neutrally-bouyant to stably stratified cases above, 
% we repeated the previous calculation with $\gamma\in[1,2]$. 
% We restore the vertical domain to $\zmax=10\epsilon r$. 
% Fig. \ref{adia_growth_num} shows the eigenfrequencies of the
% fundamental VSI mode. 


% %To select the appropriate
% %eigenvalues we vary the parameters slowly away from a reference solution.   
% % The numerically-determined eigenfrequencies are qualitatively
% % consistent with the discussion in \S\ref{adia_compare_gam1}.
% There is good agreement between Fig. \ref{adia_growth_num} and
% Fig. \ref{adia_growth} for $\khat=k_xH_\mathrm{iso}\gtrsim1$. There is a
% mismatch for smaller wavenumbers, especially in the growth
% rates. Actual growth rates decrease slower as $\khat\to0$
% than that in Fig. \ref{adia_growth}. Disagreement at small
% $\khat$ is not unexpected because the low-frequency
% approximation used to obtain Fig. \ref{adia_growth} becomes invalid since
% $|\omega|\sim\Omega_k$ for small $\khat$.  

% Given the number of approximations made in \S\ref{adia_compare_gam1},
% Fig. \ref{adia_growth_num} compares well with 
% Fig. \ref{adia_growth}. The main qualitative features of the full
% numerical solution in Fig. \ref{adia_growth_num} are captured by
% Fig. \ref{adia_growth}: stabilization for 
% $\khat\to0$ and $\khat\to\infty$,
% stabilization for increasing $\gamma$ (but ineffective at small $\khat$), 
% and the shift of the most unstable wavenumber to smaller values as
% $\gamma$ is increased.
