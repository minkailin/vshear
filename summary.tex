\section{Summary and discussion}
%what have we done, relation to previous work 
In this paper we have studied the linear axisymmetric vertical shear
instability (VSI) in astrophysical disks that arises from the
height-dependence of the equilibrium angular velocity profile
$\Omega(r,z)$ of a baroclinic  disk. The VSI was analysed and
explained earlier in the local limit by \cite{urpin98} and
\cite{urpin03}, simulated by \cite{arlt04} and more  recently by
\cite{nelson13}.     

We generalized previous vertically-global linear stability calculations
of the VSI \citep{nelson13,mcnally14}, which assumed
isothermal perturbations, to include an energy equation. Our effort
may also be regarded as an extension of \cite{urpin03}, which 
included an energy equation, by relaxing the Boussinesq and  
vertically-local approximations adopted in that analysis.  

In accordance with the above studies, which show that the VSI   
applies to perturbations with small radial lengthscales, we retained
the radially-local approximation by using the `vertically-global
shearing box' (VGSB) formalism developed by \cite{mcnally14}, who 
showed the linear VSI studied by \cite{nelson13} in a locally
isothermal disk can be captured by the VGSB.

We added an energy source term in the VGSB equations which relaxes the disk
temperature to its initial value on a timescale
$t_c=\beta\Omega_k^{-1}$. This form of thermal relaxation was also 
employed in the global numerical simulations of \cite{nelson13}, and allows
the thermodynamic response of the disk to be controlled. 

We mostly focused on vertically isothermal disks ($\Gamma=1$) because
it permits a largely analytical discussion. Our analysis is an
extension of the linear models considered in \cite{lubow93} by
adding vertical shear, but in the limit of low-frequency
perturbations in nearly-Keplerian disks. These approximations were
made for simplicity, but also motivated by previous work
\citep{nelson13}.   

For isothermal perturbations ($\gamma=1$ or $\beta=0$) we explicitly
demonstrated instability  associated with vertical shear, and that the
VSI growth rate is limited by the maximum vertical shear within the
vertical domain of interest. The fundamental VSI mode is characterized
by one node in the density perturbation at the mid-plane
(i.e. anti-symmetric about $z=0$), which corresponds to a vertical
velocity perturbation  $\delta v_z\sim\mathrm{constant}$ near $z=0$.  

% In the opposite limit of adiabatic perturbations ($\gamma>1$
% and $\beta\to\infty$), we find VSI growth rates are dramatically
% reduced on account of a stabilizing 
% vertical entropy gradient. The VSI is not completely
% surpressed because vertical shear dominates over buoyancy 
% sufficiently close the disk midplane. However, perturbations grow
% slowly and is constrained to regions immediately about the disk
% midplane. Thus, the adiabatic VSI is likely unimportant in practice. 

For non-isothermal  perturbations with thermal relaxation ($\gamma>1$,
$\beta>0$) , the general dispersion relation (Eq. \ref{relax_disp}) is
complicated and requires a numerical treatment. However, for the
fundamental VSI some simplification is  possible. In particular, we quantified the critical thermal relaxation
timescale $\beta_\mathrm{crit}=\epsilon|q|/(\gamma-1)$, below
which small-scale perturbations ($\khat\gg 1$) may be regarded as isothermal
and the fundamental VSI operates. We believe this explicit expression for
$\beta_\mathrm{crit}$ is the most useful result from our
investigation. 

We also solved the linear stability problem numerically using a
pseudo-spectral approach. Numerical solutions are mostly consistent
with our analytical expectations, except for perturbations with small
radial wavenumber ($\khat\to0$) where the low-frequency approximation
is inappropriate. The local model is also not valid for such modes.  


We briefly studied vertically non-isothermal disks using our linear 
code. We confirm the finding by \cite{nelson13} that in the absence
of vertical entropy gradients, the VSI operates and is insensitive to
thermal relaxation. When a stable stratification is introduced, the
rapid reduction in VSI growth rates by a finite thermal relaxation timescale
is qualitatively similar to that observed for vertically isothermal
disks.  

%application to MMSN 

We applied our linear results to assess the applicability of the VSI in
protoplanetary disks, specifically the Minimum Mass Solar Nebulae (MMSN),
using disk models described in \cite{chiang10}. We find the MMSN is
unstable to the fundamental VSI at $10$s of AU, with characteristic
growth times of $10$s of orbits. However, we note the strong
temperature dependence of the physical thermal relaxation timescale
in the disk model ($\beta$ decreases as $T^{-5}$ for perturbations with small
radial scale). Thus, increasing the disk temperature even slightly can signifcantly 
shorten the typical growth times for the VSI. This is also attributed
to a larger value of $\beta_\mathrm{crit}$, since increasing $T$ also
increases the aspect-ratio $\epsilon$.

\subsection{Future extensions} 
We highlight below some improvements to the present  
linear models that should be pursued:

\emph{Realistic thermal evolution.} We have treated the thermal
relaxation time $t_c$ as a constant for simplicity. However, a
physical expression for $t_c$ will depend on 
$z$. For example, the Newtonian cooling timescale
(\S\ref{newton_cool}) will depend on $z$ for vertically non-isothermal
disks, and through the opacity since 
$\kappa_d=\kappa_d(\rho,T)$ in general. 
A proper treatment for radiative diffusion, on the other hand, will
ultimately involve the Laplacian operator. In this case additional
boundary conditions must be supplemented. We will consider this in a
future work.

\emph{Additional physics.} Depending on where the VSI operates in a
disk, additional effects may become important. For example, in the
outer parts of a protoplanetary disk, where we estimate the VSI may
operate, disk self-gravity (SG) may play a role. Specifically, the vertical
shear profile depends on the vertical density stratification
(Eq. \ref{vertical_shear}), which wil be enhanced by vertical SG,
which will enhance the VSI. Inclusion of the Poisson equation should
therefore be considered. 

We have neglected viscosity. \cite{nelson13} have shown that an
alpha viscosity of $\lesssim O(10^{-4})$ is required for the VSI to
operate. It is of interest to quantify the effect of viscosity
on the linear VSI. This would help identify, more accurately, the
appropriate regions in a protoplanetary disk that are sufficiently
laminar to develop the VSI.  This problem is, however, complicated by
the fact that proper inclusion of viscosity introduces viscous heating
in the energy equation. 


\emph{Geometry.} Extrapolating our results from the shearing box to a global disk  
has an inconsistency. Namely, the equilibrium temperature in the
box only depends on height (if at all). However, it is precisely the
radial temperature (or entropy) gradient in the global disk that
gives rise to vertical shear. We do not expect this to be a serious issue for 
perturbations with small radial wavelengths, 
%explicitly checked by including global terms 
but will need to be resolved by adopting global disk models  
if one wishes to generalize the VSI to large-scale perturbations. 


% \emph{Theoretical generalizations.} Our analytical discussion
% (\S\ref{analytical}) can be extended in several ways. One could
% relax the low-frequency approximation to improve the agreement between
% numerical and analytical eigenfrequencies at small $\khat$. However,
% such modes are radially more global, and would need a global
% cylindrical disk model to study them. Another minor improvement is to
