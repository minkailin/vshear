\section{Analytical discussion of vertically isothermal
  disks in the framework of the vertically global shearing
  box}\label{analytical}  
We begin with a discussion of vertically isothermal disks
where $\Gamma=1$, then $c_s$ is a constant in the radially-local
approximation. % We examine isothermal perturbations ($\beta =
% 0$) before considering the effect of finite thermal relaxation. 
In order to facilitate a fully analytic discussion, we first introduce a
number of approximations below that allows a simple governing equation
to be derived and compared with previous works.  However, all of the 
approximations described in
\S\ref{vgsb_approx}---\S\ref{analytic_relax} are relaxed in our
numerical study.    

\subsection{Relation to the vertically global
  shearing box}\label{vgsb_approx} 
We connect the linearized equations 
Eq. \ref{lin_mass}---\ref{lin_energy} to the vertically global  
shearing box (VGSB) formalism developed by \cite{mcnally14}. The VGSB
is an extension of the standard shearing box \citep{goldreich65} to
allow the shear flow in the shearing box to be height-dependent. 
The difference between the radially local
approximation and the VGSB is that the equilibrium disk
structure is assumed to be homogeneous in the radial ($x$) direction,
as in the 
standard shearing box.  

Thus, the linear problem in the VGSB can be derived from
Eq. \ref{lin_mass}---\ref{lin_energy} by setting 
$\hat{g}_c=0$. The resulting problem is very similar 
to that for local axisymmetric waves in accretion disks already
discussed by \cite{lubow93}, but modified by the presence of vertical
shear and thermal relaxation. This is convenient as it allows us to
directly apply some of their solution methods.    

After setting $\hat{g}_c=0$ in Eq. \ref{lin_mass}, \ref{lin_vx} and
\ref{lin_energy}, we can eliminate variables % eliminate the perturbed velocities between
% the linearized equations 
to obtain a pair or ordinary differential
equations for $W,Q$ as
\begin{align}
  &\frac{\sigma^2}{c_s^2}Q + \frac{\sigma^2k_x^2}{D}W \notag\\ 
  &=\left(\frac{\ii
      k_x r}{D}\frac{d\Omega^2}{dz} -
    \frac{d\ln{\rho}}{dz}\right)\left[\frac{dW}{dz} +
    \frac{d\ln{\rho}}{dz}\left(W-Q\right)\right] \notag\\
  &- \frac{d^2W}{dz^2} - \frac{d\ln{\rho}}{dz}\left(\frac{dW}{dz} -
    \frac{dQ}{dz}\right) - \frac{d^2\ln{\rho}}{dz^2}\left(W-Q\right),\label{ode_w}\\
  &\sigma^2W - \frac{\gamma}{\Gamma}\sigma^2 Q +
  \frac{\ii\sigma}{t_c}\left(W-\frac{Q}{\Gamma}\right)\notag\\
  &=c_s^2\frac{d\ln{\rho}}{dz}\left(\frac{\gamma}{\Gamma} - 1\right) 
  \left[\frac{dW}{dz} + \frac{d\ln{\rho}}{dz}\left(W-Q\right)\right],\label{ode_Q} 
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
  D \equiv \kappa^2 - \sigma^2,
\end{align} 
and we have replaced the notation $\p_z$ by $d/dz$ since we are
considering solutions at a fixed radius. 

Extrapolating results obtained from the VGSB to the global disk has
limitations. This is because within the VGSB framework, $d\Omega/dz$
can be freely specified. %  In effect, by adopting the VGSB framework, we are studying
% dynamics in the standard shearing box subject to an additional
% azimuthal force $\delta v_zr d \Omega/dz$ with $d\Omega/dz$ as an
% input parameter. 
%For consistency with the global disk, 
We choose $d\Omega/dz$ to be that due to the thermal structure in 
the global disk (Eq. \ref{vertical_shear}). However, background radial
gradient terms are ignored elsewhere in the VGSB (which is done by
setting $\hat{g}_c=0$).       

%the above inconsistency

We further discuss caveats of the VGSB in Appendix
\ref{global_corr}. We find that for perturbations with small radial
lengthscales ($k_xH\gg 1$) and fast thermal relaxation ($\beta\ll1$),
which characterizes the VSI, the VGSB framework is adequate for the 
purpose of a simple analytical treatment. 

\subsection{Low-frequency and nearly-Keplerian
  approximation}\label{approx_gov} 
We now derive a governing equation with further approximations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item We consider eigenvalues such that
  $|\sigma^2|\ll \kappa^2$. Then we can replace $D=\kappa^2 -\sigma^2\to
  \kappa^2$. % The problem simplifies because the eigenvalue now only
  % appears in the last term in Eq. \ref{iso_ode}. %stoll kley see low
  % freq 
  We call this the low-frequency approximation. 
\item We are mainly interested in the effect of vertical shear, i.e. $q\neq
  0$. This is already captured explicitly in the linearized equations through
  the term $d\Omega/dz$. We therefore simplify 
  further by ignoring the vertical dependence of $\Omega$ and $\kappa$
  elsewhere. For clarity, we replace $\kappa^2$ with
  $\Omega_k^2$. We call this the nearly-Keplerian approximation. 
  
\end{enumerate}
Making both of these approximations is equivalent to setting 
$D\to\Omega_k^2$.  After making this replacement, we eliminate $W$ and
$Q$ between  Eq. \ref{lin_vz} and Eq. \ref{ode_w}---\ref{ode_Q},
making use of Eq. \ref{vertical_shear}, to
obtain an equation for $\delta v_z$. The result for $\Gamma=1$ is
\begin{align}
  0 =& \frac{d^2\delta v_z}{dz^2} + \left(1 + \frac{\ii k_x c_s^2
      q}{\Omega_k^2r}\right)\frac{d\ln\rho}{dz}\frac{d\delta
    v_z}{dz} \notag\\
  % &+ \left[\sigma^2\left(\frac{k_x^2}{\Omega_k^2} +
  %     \frac{\chi}{c_s^2}\right) + \left(\chi + \frac{\ii k_x c_s^2
  &+ \left[\frac{\sigma^2}{c_s^2}\left(\frac{k_x^2c_s^2}{\Omega_k^2} +
      \chi\right) + \left(\chi + \frac{\ii k_x c_s^2
        q}{\Omega_k^2r}\right)\frac{d^2\ln\rho}{dz^2}\right. \notag\\
  &\phantom{+=}\left.-
    \frac{c_s^2}{\Omega_k^2}\left(\frac{d\ln\rho}{dz}\right)^2\left(k_x^2 -
      \frac{\ii k_x q}{r}\right)
    \left(1-\chi\right) 
  \right]\delta v_z,\label{vertiso_gov}
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
  \chi \equiv \frac{1-\ii\sigma t_c}{1-\ii\sigma t_c\gamma}.
\end{align}

It is convenient to introduce the dimensionless variables
\begin{align}
  \hat{z} = z/H,\quad \hat{k}=k_xH, \quad \hat{\sigma} =\hat{\omega} +
  \ii\hat{\nu}= \sigma/\Omega_k,
\end{align}
where $\hat{\omega}$ and $\hat{\nu}$ are real. 
Eq. \ref{vertiso_gov} becomes 
\begin{align}
  0=& \delta v_z ^{\prime\prime} + \left(1 + \ii\epsilon
    q\hat{k}\right)\ln\rho^{\prime}\delta v_z^\prime \notag\\
  &+
  \left[\hat{\sigma}^2\left(\hat{k}^2+\chi\right) +
    \left(  \chi + \ii \epsilon q\hat{k}\right)\ln\rho^{\prime\prime}\right.
  \notag\\
  &\left.- \ln\rho^{\prime
      2}\left(\khat^2 -
      \ii\epsilon
      q\hat{k}\right)\left(1 - \chi\right)\right]\delta v_z,\label{vertiso_gov_nondim}
\end{align}
where $^\prime$ denotes $d/d\zhat$.%  Eq. \ref{vertiso_gov_nondim} will
% be the basis for our discussion of vertically isothermal disks. 

In deriving Eq. \ref{vertiso_gov}, the vertical dependence of
$D=\kappa^2(z)-\sigma^2$ was ignored because the replacement
$D\to\Omega_k^2$ was made before eliminating variables in favor of
$\delta v_z$. In Appendix \ref{adia_improve} we show that making this
replacement after eliminating variables, which involves $dD/dz$,
introduces terms $O(\epsilon^2)$. Since we are interested in 
thin disks ($\epsilon\ll 1 $), e.g. protoplaneary disks where 
$\epsilon\lesssim 0.1$ \citep{chiang10}, these terms introduce
unnecessary complexity for the present discussion. % However, this
% approximation will be relaxed in our numerical study.  


% Note that we can generalize Eq. \ref{vertiso_gov_nondim} non-Keplerian
% rotation profiles by redefining $\khat$ as $k_xc_s/\kappa$,
% $\hat{\sigma}$ as $\sigma/\kappa$, and  $\epsilon$ as $c_s/r\kappa$.     





      

% This expression can be simplified in the limit $|q|\ll 1$, 
%  \begin{align}\label{simple_growth}
%    \frac{\imag(\sigma)}{\Omega_k} = \pm \sqrt{M} 
%    \frac{q\epsilon\hat{k}}{2\sqrt{1+\hat{k}^2}} \quad\quad (|q|\ll 1), 
%  \end{align}
%  with $M$ being an integer. 

% In Appendix \ref{pert_theory} we give an alternative method to
% infer instability in the presence of vertical shear without explicitly
% solving the governing equation.
