\section{Vertical shear instability of locally
  isothermal perturbations}
The linear problem simplifies considerably for the case
$\gamma=1$. That is, for locally isothermal perturbations where
\begin{align}
  W=Q,
\end{align}
so that
\begin{align}
  \delta v_z = \frac{1}{\ii\sigma}\frac{dQ}{dz}. 
\end{align}
Inserting this into the expression for $\delta v_x$ and the continuity
equation, we arrive at a single equation for the linear stability
problem,
\begin{align}\label{iso_ode}
  \frac{d^2Q}{dz^2} + \left(\frac{d\ln{\rho}}{dz} - \frac{\ii k_x
      r}{D}\frac{d\Omega^2}{dz}\right) \frac{dQ}{dz} +
  \sigma^2\left(\frac{1}{c_s^2} + \frac{k_x^2}{D}\right)=0, 
\end{align} 
subject to appropriate boundary conditions. 

\subsection{Approximations}
Eq. \ref{iso_ode} is still complicated because the coefficients depend
on $z$ in a non-trivial manner. Furthermore, the eigenfrequency
$\sigma^2$ appears in $D$. In order to make progress, in this section
we make the following approximations. 

\emph{Thin disk.} We consider thin disks with $h\ll1$, so we may expand the
background density and vertical shear in powers of $z/r$. To lowest
order we obtain
\begin{align}
  &\rho(z) \simeq \rho_{00} \exp{\left(-\frac{z^2}{2H^2}\right)},\\
  &\frac{d\Omega^2}{dz} \simeq \frac{q\Omega_k^2z}{r^2}. 
\end{align}

\emph{Low frequency.} We consider eigenvalues such that
$|\sigma^2|\ll \kappa^2$. Then we can replace $D=\kappa^2 -\sigma^2\to
\kappa^2$. The problem simplifies because the eigenvalue now only
appears in the last term in Eq. \ref{iso_ode}. 

% \emph{Nearly constant $\kappa$}. We are mainly interested in the
% effect of vertical shear, i.e. $q\neq 0$. This is already captured
% explicitly in Eq. \ref{iso_ode}. We therefore simplify further by
% ignoring the vertical dependence of $\kappa^2$. In a thin disk, this
% quantity is nearly Keplerian.

With the above approximations and introducing the dimensionless
vertical co-ordinate $\hat{z} \equiv z/H$, the governing equation becomes
\begin{align}\label{iso_ode2}
  &\frac{d^2Q}{d\hat{z}^2} - \left[ 1 + \ii qh
    \left(k_xH\right)\frac{\Omega_k^2}{\kappa^2}\right]\hat{z}\frac{dQ}{d\hat{z}}\notag\\
  &+ \sigma^2H^2\left(\frac{1}{c_s^2}+\frac{k_x^2}{\kappa^2}\right)Q =
  0. 
\end{align}

We are mainly interested in the effect of vertical shear, i.e. $q\neq
0$. This is already captured explicitly in Eq. \ref{iso_ode2}. We 
therefore simplify further by ignoring the vertical dependence of
$\kappa^2$ and replace it by $\Omega_k^2$. This is expected to be
valid in a thin disk. Our final equation is then

\begin{align}\label{iso_ode3}
  \frac{d^2Q}{d\hat{z}^2} - \left(1 + \ii qh
    \hat{k}\right)\hat{z}\frac{dQ}{d\hat{z}} +
  \left(\frac{\sigma}{\Omega_k}\right)^2\left(1+\hat{k}^2\right)Q = 
  0, 
\end{align}
where we have introduced the dimensionless wavenumber $\hat{k}
\equiv k_x H$ for convenience. 

\subsection{Neccessity of vertical shear for instability}
Writing
\begin{align}
  V \equiv Q\exp{\left[-\frac{\hat{z}^2}{2}(\ii q h
      \hat{k})\right]},
\end{align}
we have an alternative form of the governing equation 
\begin{align}\label{iso_alt}
  \frac{d}{d\hat{z}}\left[w(\hat{z})\left(\frac{dV}{d\hat{z}} + \ii q h
    \hat{k}\hat{z}V\right)\right] + n^2V w(\hat{z}) =0, 
\end{align}
where 
\begin{align}
  w(\hat{z}) \equiv \exp{\left(-\frac{\hat{z}^2}{2}\right)},  
\end{align}
and we have defined a new eigenvalue
\begin{align}
  n^2 \equiv \left(\frac{\sigma}{\Omega_k}\right)^2(1+\hat{k}^2). 
\end{align}

Next, we multiply Eq. \ref{iso_alt} by $V^{*}$, integrate
vertically and assume boundary terms vanish to obtain
\begin{align}\label{integral_relation}
  n^2\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}w|V|^2d\hat{z} 
  =&\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}w\left|\frac{dV}{d\hat{z}}\right|^2d\hat{z}\notag\\
  +&\ii q h \hat{k}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}w\hat{z}V\frac{dV^*}{d\hat{z}}d\hat{z}.   
\end{align}
It follows that for instability ($\imag\sigma>0$ and therefore $\imag
n^2 \neq 0$), it is neccessary to have $q\neq 0$, i.e. vertical
shear. We will use this integral relation to estimate growth
rates. 

\subsection{Stability in the absence of vertical shear}
When $q=0$, the governing equation is
\begin{align}
  \frac{d}{d\hat{z}}\left[w(\hat{z})\frac{dV}{d\hat{z}}\right] + n^2V
  w(\hat{z}) =0, 
\end{align}
i.e. Hermite's differential equation. For bounded solutions we have 
\begin{align}
  V\propto \He_n(\hat{z}),
\end{align}
and $n$ is a non-negative integer. This translates to
\begin{align}
  \left|\frac{\sigma}{\Omega_k}\right| = n
  \left(1+\hat{k}^2\right)^{-1/2}. 
\end{align}
Since we have assumed $|\sigma^2|\ll \kappa^2$, our analysis is only
valid for large wavenumbers such that $\hat{k}^2\gg 
n^2-1$. Physically, this corresponds to radial length-scales much
smaller than the local disk scale height. From   

\subsection{Instability in the presence of weak vertical shear}
To investigate the destabilizing effect of vertical shear, we first
consider a system with $q\equiv0$, for which the eigenfunctions are
Hermite polynomials and the real eigenfrequencies are known. We then
perturb this system by introducing a weak vertical shear ($|q|\ll1$)
and linearize the governing equation. This procedure is
\begin{align}   
  &q \to 0 + \delta q\\
  &V \to \He_n + \delta V \\
  &\sigma \to \sigma + \delta\sigma, 
\end{align}
where for this exercise we restore $\sigma$ as the eigenfrequency. 

Linearizing the integral Eq. \ref{integral_relation} and taking the
imaginary part, we have
