\begin{abstract}
  It is difficult to understand how cold circumstellar disks accrete onto their central stars.  Due to 
  lower levels of ionization, the magnetic transport mechanisms that operate in warmer disks are less effective. 
  A hydrodynamic mechanism, the vertical shear instability (VSI), offers a means to drive angular momentum 
  transport in cold accretion disks such as protoplanetary disks.  
  The VSI is driven by a weak vertical gradient in the disk's orbital motion.
  In order to grow, the VSI must overcome vertical buoyancy, a strong stabilizing influence in cold disks, where 
  heating is dominated by external irradiation.  Rapid cooling, via radiative losses, reduces the effective buoyancy
  and allows the VSI to operate.  In this paper, we quantify the cooling timescale, $t_c$, needed for growth of the VSI
  and consider the implications for protoplanetary disks where $t_c$ is determined by the opacity of dust 
  grains.  We perform a linear analysis of the VSI with cooling in vertically global and radially local disk models.
  For irradiated disks, we find that the VSI is most vigorous for rapid cooling with $t_c < \Omega_K^{-1} \epsilon |q| / (\gamma -1)$
  in terms of the Keplerian orbital frequency, $\OmK$; the disk's aspect ratio, $\epsilon \ll 1$; the radial 
  powerlaw temperature gradient, $q$; and the adiabatic index, $\gamma$.  For longer cooling times, the VSI 
  is much less effective because growth slows and shifts to smaller length scales, which are more prone to 
  viscous or turbulent decay.  We apply our results to a  Minimum Mass Solar Nebula (MMSN) disk model.  We
  find that the VSI is most effective at intermediate radii, from $\sim 5$AU to $\sim 50$AU with a
  characteristic growth time of $\sim 30$ local orbital periods.  Growth is suppressed by long cooling times both in the opaque 
  inner disk and the optically thin outer disk.  A reduction in the dust opacity by a factor of 10 increases cooling times 
  enough to quench the VSI at all disk radii.  Thus the formation of solid protoplanets, a sink for dust grains, can impede the VSI.

%  lengthscales of $O(10^{-2}H)$ to $O(10^{-1}H)$, we find the MMSN is
%  unstable to the VSI from $\sim 5$AU to $\sim 50$AU with a
%  characteristic growth time of $\sim 30$ local orbital periods.  
%  % ,and the dominant VSI mode in the MMSN is the `fundamental
%  % corrugation mode' which causes the disk column to oscillate
%  % vertically.
%  We thus suggest the VSI is at least dynamically important in the 
%  outer parts of protoplanetary disks at tens of AU.

\section{Introduction}\label{intro}
Understanding the mechanisms of angular momentum transport is the
central problem in the theory of accretion disks 
\citep{lyndenbell74}. The   
magneto-rotational instability in the context of differentially
rotating disks \citep[MRI,][]{balbus91} is now accepted as a robust
pathway to magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, which transports
angular momentum outwards and thus enables mass accretion. 

However, MHD turbulence may not be applicable to all  
accretion disks. For example, there may be regions in protoplanetary  
disks (PPDs) which do not support the MRI 
\citep{gammie96,landry13}. In fact, recent MHD simulations
suggest significant portions of PPDs remain laminar \citep[e.g.][and references
therein]{lesur14,bai15,gressel15}. Thus, alternative mechanisms 
to angular momentum transport in PPDs, such as purely hydrodynamic
turbulence,  remain of interest \citep{armitage10}. In addition to
mass accretion, turbulence in PPDs will also
impact dust evolution and planetesimal formation \citep{chiang10}. 

One possible route to hydrodynamic turbulence is the vertical shear
instability (VSI). The VSI is an 
axisymmetric linear instability 
in three-dimensional (3D) disks in which the rotation frequency
$\Omega$ depends on the height $z$ from the disk midplane. 
Vertical shear occurs whenever the disk is baroclinic, i.e.\ when constant 
density and constant pressure surfaces are misaligned.  Baroclinicity, and thus vertical shear, is 
practically unavoidable in disks, except at special locations like the midplane.

The VSI  in disks is fundamentally equivalent to the
Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke instability 
\citep[GSFI,][]{goldreich67,fricke68} in differentially rotating stars.   
A height-dependence in $\Omega$, or vertical shear, can render
inertial waves unstable. \cite{barker15} gives a simple 
interpretation of the VSI: in an axisymmetric, inviscid, neutrally
stratified disk, the exchange of fluid parcels vertically, while
conserving their specific angular momentum, can result in a new
configuration of lower energy if the distribution of specific angular
momentum varies with $z$. The VSI is characterized by perturbations
with large vertical length-scales  relative to radial length-scales.   

Early analysis of the VSI in radially and vertically local 
models of accretion disks \citep{urpin98,urpin03} showed that the VSI
requires a short thermal timescale so that perturbations evolve 
isothermally, unless the disk is neutrally stratified in the vertical
direction. This is because
vertical motions associated with the VSI 
are stabilized by buoyancy forces if the disk is sub-adiabatically
stratified (convectively stable). A sufficiently short thermal
timescale renders buoyancy ineffective, but a quantitative criteria is
desirable. This is our primary goal.  
%efficient exchang of heat with surroundings 

The need for a short thermal timescale for the VSI to operate in
stably stratified disks has been demonstrated in recent numerical simulations 
\citep{nelson13,stoll14}. When the  thermal timescale $t_c$ is
parametrized in units of the orbital period  $P_\mathrm{orb}$,
\cite{nelson13} find that $t_c\lesssim  0.01P_\mathrm{orb}$ was needed
to observe the VSI. That is, the  disk temperature needs to remain
effectively unchanged. Radiation hydrodynamic simulations performed by
\cite{stoll14} also showed that the VSI is only sustained with the
inclusion of heating from stellar irradiation, which results in an
effective thermal timescale $t_c\ll P_\mathrm{orb}$ that maintains a
fixed temperature profile.     

These studies show that the VSI is generally sensitive to disk
thermodynamics. It is thus important to quantify this dependence, for
example on disk parameters, in order to evaluate the relevance of the
VSI to realistic disks, which one may expect to be stably
stratified and have non-zero thermal timescales.  In order to determine
where in the disk the VSI may operate, and hence lead to hydrodynamic
turbulence, understanding the thermodynamic dependence of the linear VSI is essential. 
% since the transition
% Should a disk
% become turbulent through the VSI, it must first pass through the linear
% instability.


In this work we study the linear VSI in radially local, vertically
global models of astrophysical disks. This approach has
been adopted in recent studies of the linear VSI
\citep{nelson13,mcnally14,barker15}. However, these studies consider 
isothermal perturbations, for which the thermal timescale is formally
zero, and/or neutrally stratified disks in which buoyancy forces are
absent by construction. We account for both effects to study the
VSI in more general disk models. To do so, we examine 
sub-adiabatically stratified disks and include an energy equation 
with a source term that allows the thermodynamic response of 
perturbations to be varied smoothly between isothermal and 
adiabatic.   





% Our models are also an extension of earlier 
% analysis by \cite{urpin98} and \cite{urpin03}, which accounts for thermal
% evolution, but considered vertically localized disturbances.
% Our 
% vertically global approach is necessary to study disturbances with
% vertical wavelengths comparable to or larger than the disk scale
% height. Such disturbances were found by \cite{nelson13} and
% \cite{stoll14} to dominate their numerical simulations. We thus focus
% on vertically global perturbations which, in fact, we find to be the
% dominant mode in protoplanetary disks with a realistic estimate for
% the thermodynamic timescales. 

This paper is organized as follows. We first highlight in
\S\ref{vsi_require} the need of a very short thermal timescale for the
VSI to operate in stably stratified disks. There we also preview our
main result --- a quantitative thermodynamic criteria for the VSI ---
and a first application to protoplanetary disks. The remaining sections
are devoted to deriving these results from linear theory. 

In \S\ref{setup} we list the governing equations and global
equilibrium disk models under   
consideration. We formulate the linear stability problem in 
\S\ref{linear} and simplify it by making the radially local
approximation. We study the linear problem using two approaches. In
\S\ref{analytical} we present an analytical discussion of vertically
isothermal disks. Our treatment is grossly simplified owing to a
number of approximations made, but closely parallels previous work, 
allowing us to highlight the essential effects of vertical shear, and to
derive a characteristic upper limit to the thermal timescale for the
VSI. This timescale is \emph{much shorter} than the dynamical
timescale. In \S\ref{numerical} we numerically
solve the linear problem in the radially local approximation, but
relax all other approximations made in our analytical approach.    
We find basic agreement with our analysis, including
the aforementioned characteristic thermal timescale. 

In
\S\ref{application} we apply our results to the Minimum Mass
Solar Nebula (MMSN) by modeling thermal 
timescales based on realistic disk properties, and find that the VSI
can operate effectively in the outer parts of the MMSN. We summarize in
\S\ref{summary} with a discussion of caveats and possible directions
for future work.  



\section{Thermodynamic requirement for the vertical shear instability}\label{vsi_require}     In this paper we will find that in a stably stratified thin disk, the VSI  
requires a thermal timescale $t_c$ much less than the
disk dynamical timescale, 
\begin{align}
  t _c \ll \Omega_k^{-1}. 
\end{align}
where $\Omega_k$ is the Keplerian frequency. 
To see why this should be expected, we need to compare vertical shear
with vertical buoyancy. For this preliminary discussion we consider a
vertically isothermal disk with aspect-ratio $\epsilon$,  
dimensionless radial temperature gradient $q$ and adiabatic index
$\gamma$. For a protoplanetary disk, $\epsilon \sim 0.05$, $|q|\sim 1$ and $\gamma\simeq 1.4$. 

For a thin disk, the specific angular momentum varies with height as 
\begin{align}\label{vshear_thin}
  r \frac{\p \Omega^2 }{\p z} \simeq \epsilon q \Omega_k^2\left(\frac{z}{H}\right),
\end{align}
where $H$ is the disk scale height. As noted in
\S\ref{intro} this vertical variation is a source of free energy and
thus vertical shear ($\p_z\Omega \neq0$) is destabilizing. 

For $\gamma>1$ the disk is stably stratified with a real vertical
buoyancy frequency $N_z$.  In a thin disk,     
\begin{align}\label{nz_thin}
  N_z^2 \simeq \left(\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}\right) \left(\frac{z}{H}\right)^2
  \Omega_k^2.  
\end{align}
This provides a stabilizing effect as buoyancy opposes vertical
motion, which is required for the VSI. In fact, if we consider
axisymmetric adiabatic disturbances, then because the 
Solberg-Hoiland criteria \citep{tassoul78} are usually satisified in a
thin disk, the disk would be stable. 

However, the stabilizing effect of buoyancy can be mitigated for 
effectively isothermal disturbances. Consider a fluid element displaced upwards, away from
the disk midplane. In a stably stratified adiabatic disk, it would
sink because of buoyancy. However, if thermal timescales are short, in
that temperature flucations decay rapidly, then the fluid element would attain its surrounding 
density and  
%(assuming an ideal gas and it reaches pressure 
%equilibrium with its surroundings). 
thus buoyancy is rendered ineffective. Qualitatively, a short thermal
timescale $t_c$ reduces the effective (stabilizing) buoyancy force.    

How short must $t_c$ be for vertical shear to prevail? A rough 
comparison of vertical shear to buoyancy for non-adiabatic
perturbations can be obtained by applying Eq. 47 of \cite{urpin03}, which is based on 
\cite{townsend58},   
\begin{align}\label{bcrit_est}
  N_z^2 t_c \lesssim \left|r\frac{\p\Omega}{\p z}\right|. 
\end{align}
The left-hand side represents an effective buoyancy, which is
stabilizing; while the right-hand side represents vertical shear,
which is destabilizing. In a thin disk $\epsilon \ll 1$, so the destabilizing effect of 
vertical shear is rather weak because $|r\p_z\Omega|\sim\epsilon\Omega_k
\ll \Omega_k$. By comparison, the buoyancy frequency $N_z\sim
\Omega_k$. It follows that $t_c\lesssim O(\epsilon\Omega_k^{-1})$ is
required for instability.  \emph{In a thin  
  disk the thermal timescale must be shorter than the dynamical
  timescale by $O(\epsilon)\ll 1$ for the VSI to operate.}   


To illustrate this point, we show in Fig. \ref{eqm_structure} the
equilibrium structure of a typical protoplanetary disk. %Here $\rho_0$
%is the midplane density and vertical shear rate and buoyancy
%frequencies are normalized by the local Keplerian frequency. 
It is
clear that vertical shear is 
generally weak compared to buoyancy. Then even a small (positive)
vertical entropy gradient can significantly stabilize the VSI. 
Note that in astrophysical disks both $N_z^2$ and $\p_z\Omega$ varies
with height. Eq. \ref{bcrit_est} then suggest that with
increasing height, buoyancy would eventually stabilize the VSI (since
$N_z^2\propto z^2$ and $\p_z\Omega\propto z$).
% This means that 
% disturbances localized away from the disk midplane are easily stabilized by
% buoyancy. 
This argument assumes vertically localized disturbances. It is,
however, not clear how to apply Eq. \ref{bcrit_est} to vertically
global disturbances, as considered in this work.

\begin{figure*}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/rhoshearNz}
  \caption{Typical protoplanetary disk structure (the Minimum Mass
    Solar Nebla): density (left), vertical shear rate (middle) and
    buoyancy frequency (right). Here $\rho_0$ is the midplane density.  
    \label{eqm_structure} 
  }
\end{figure*}


Our central result is the requirement 
\begin{align}\label{prelim_bcrit}
  (\gamma - 1)t_c < \epsilon |q| \Omega_k^{-1}
\end{align}   
for the VSI in a vertically isothermal, thin disk. This equation
reflects Eq. \ref{bcrit_est} but there is no $z$ dependence. 
% While assumptions and simplifications will be made 
% to derive this, 
Eq. \ref{prelim_bcrit} can be 
readily applied to evaluate where in a disk the VSI is likely to
operate. For example, we show in Fig. \ref{bcrit_mmsn2d} an estimate
of the thermal timescales the protoplanetary disk model shown in
Fig. \ref{eqm_structure}. Here $k_x$ is a radial
wavenumber of the disturbance being considered, thus larger $k_x$
correspond to smaller perturbations. The region outside the red line
satisfies Eq. \ref{prelim_bcrit}. 

The criterion Eq. \ref{prelim_bcrit} in fact
assumes $t_c$ is vertically uniform. While this is not generally true
in the inner disk, we find Eq. \ref{prelim_bcrit} still provides a
useful guide. We see that the VSI will operate in the outer 
disk at tens of AU, but that smaller scale disturbances may operate at
smaller radii.

    (the region outside the line).

We now proceed through the formal linear stability problem to arrive
at Eq. \ref{prelim_bcrit} and verify it numerically. The interested 
reader may skip forward \S\ref{application} for the application of our
results to protoplanetary disks.
