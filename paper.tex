\begin{abstract}
  Baroclinic astrophysical disks with equilibrium rotation profiles
  $\Omega$ that depends on the distance away from the disk midplane are
  potentially unstable to the Vertical Shear Instability (VSI). It is
  is important to understand the linear instability before
  considering the VSI as a hydrodynamic route to turbulent angular
  momentum transport in accretion disks. We study the linear,
  axisymmetric VSI in radially-local but vertically-global models
  of accretion disks. We include an energy equation with thermal
  relaxation on a characteristic timescale $t_c=\beta\Omega_k^{-1}$,
  where $\beta$ is a dimensionless parameter and $\Omega_k$ is the
  Keplerian rotation frequency, and explore how the VSI depends on the
  thermodynamic response  of the disk by varying $\beta$. We find
  increasing $\beta$ away from zero dramatically reduces VSI growth
  rates because this generally introduces a strongly stabilizing
  vertical entropy gradient. Our linear calculations are consistent
  with previous hydrodynamic simulations, which indicates the VSI 
  requires a short thermal relaxation timscale. For vertically  
  isothermal disks, we quantify `fast'
  thermal relaxation as $\beta < \epsilon|q|/(\gamma-1)$, where
  $\epsilon$ is the disk aspect-ratio, $q$ is the radial power-law
  index for the equilibrium temperature profile (which gives rise to vertical 
  shear) and $\gamma$ is the adiabatic index. We apply our linear
  results to a disk model of the Minimum Mass Solar Nebulae (MMSN), and
  find the MMSN is unstable to the VSI at tens of AU with a
  characteristic growth times of tens of local orbital periods. We 
  suggest the VSI is a viable mechanism for angular momentum
  transport in the outer parts of protoplanetary disks.

\section{Introduction}
% stuff about hydrodynamic angular momentum transport 
Understanding the mechanisms of angular mometum transport is the
central problem in the theory of accretion disks 
\citep{lyndenbell74}. The   
magneto-rotational instability in the context of differentially
rotating disks \citep[MRI,][]{balbus91} is now accepted as a robust
pathway to magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, which transports
angular momentum outwards and thus enables mass accretion. 

However, MHD turbulence may not be applicable for all  
accretion disks. For example, there may be regions in protoplanetary  
disks (PPDs) which do not support the MRI 
\citep{gammie96,landry13}. In fact, recent  numerical simulations
suggest portions of PPDs remain laminar \citep[e.g.][and references
therein]{lesur14,bai15,gressel15}. In this respect, alternative routes 
to angular momentum transport in PPDs remain of interest
\citep{armitage10}. 
 
%recent work on vsi 
One possibiliy is purely hydrodynamic turbulence through the vertical
shear instability (VSI). The VSI is an axisymmetric linear instability
in three-dimensional (3D) disks in which the rotation frequency
$\Omega$ depends on the height from the disk midplane. The VSI is the
disk analog of the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke instability
\citep[GSF,]{goldreich67,fricke68} in differentially rotating stars.   
The height-dependence of $\Omega$, or vertical shear, enables
perturbations with large vertical lengthscales (relative to radial
lengthscales) to become unstable.    
\cite{umurhan13} gives a simple explanation for this 
instability: an exchange of fluid parcels while conserving their
angular momenta individually, may result in a new configuration of
lower energy, if the exchange occurs over a sufficiently large
vertical displacement.  

%history 

The VSI has been studied analytically in local approximation
\citep{urpin98,urpin03}, where a Fourier analysis was performed in 
both the radial and vertical directions. Simulations of the  
VSI have been performed by \cite{arlt04}, and more recently by 
\cite{nelson13}. In these simulations the authors indeed observe the
growth of vertically-global but radially-localized perturbations when
the equilibrium rotation varied with height.  

An important finding from these works is that the VSI requires a short
thermal timescale: perturbations need to be close to
isothermal, unless the disk is neutrally stratified in the vertical
direction. This is because vertical motions are stabilized by
buoyancy if the disk is sub-adiabatically stratified, as required for
convective stability. When the thermal timescale $t_c$ is parametrized
in units of the orbital period $P$, \cite{nelson13} find that
$t_c\lesssim 0.01P$ was needed to observe instability. That is, the
temperature profile of the disk essentially remains unchanged during
the disk evolution. This has been confirmed by 
\cite{stoll14}, who find the 
VSI is only sustained in radiation hydrodynamic simulations 
with the inclusion of heating from stellar irradiation.    

%why linear approach? computationally fast (need very high resolution) 
%can be used as a first estimate 

From these works it is clear that the VSI is sensitive 
to the thermodynamic response of the disk except in the special case of neutrally
stratified disks. It is therefore important to understand this dependence in order to evaluate
the viability of the VSI in realistic disks. However,
