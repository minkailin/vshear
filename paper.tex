\begin{abstract}
  Baroclinic astrophysical disks with equilibrium rotation profiles
  $\Omega$ that depends on the distance away from the disk midplane are
  potentially unstable to the Vertical Shear Instability (VSI). It is
  is important to understand the linear instability before
  considering the VSI as a hydrodynamic route to turbulent angular
  momentum transport in accretion disks. We study the linear,
  axisymmetric VSI in radially-local but vertically-global models
  of accretion disks. We include an energy equation with thermal
  relaxation on a characteristic timescale $t_c=\beta\Omega_k^{-1}$,
  where $\beta$ is a dimensionless parameter and $\Omega_k$ is the
  Keplerian rotation frequency, and explore how the VSI depends on the
  thermodynamic response  of the disk by varying $\beta$. We find
  increasing $\beta$ away from zero dramatically reduces VSI growth
  rates because this generally introduces a strongly stabilizing
  vertical entropy gradient. Our linear calculations are consistent
  with previous hydrodynamic simulations, which indicates the VSI 
  requires a short thermal relaxation timescale. For vertically  
  isothermal disks, we quantify `fast'
  thermal relaxation as $\beta < \epsilon|q|/(\gamma-1)$, where
  $\epsilon$ is the disk aspect-ratio, $q$ is the radial power-law
  index for the equilibrium temperature profile (which gives rise to vertical 
  shear) and $\gamma$ is the adiabatic index. We apply our linear
  results to a disk model of the Minimum Mass Solar Nebulae (MMSN), and
  find the MMSN is unstable to the VSI at tens of AU with a
  characteristic growth times of tens of local orbital periods. This 
  suggests the VSI is  dynamically important in the outer parts of protoplanetary disks.

\section{Introduction}
% stuff about hydrodynamic angular momentum transport 
Understanding the mechanisms of angular momentum transport is the
central problem in the theory of accretion disks 
\citep{lyndenbell74}. The   
magneto-rotational instability in the context of differentially
rotating disks \citep[MRI,][]{balbus91} is now accepted as a robust
pathway to magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, which transports
angular momentum outwards and thus enables mass accretion. 

However, MHD turbulence may not be applicable for all  
accretion disks. For example, there may be regions in protoplanetary  
disks (PPDs) which do not support the MRI 
\citep{gammie96,landry13}. In fact, recent  numerical simulations
suggest portions of PPDs remain laminar \citep[e.g.][and references
therein]{lesur14,bai15,gressel15}. In this respect, alternative routes 
to angular momentum transport in PPDs remain of interest
\citep{armitage10}. 
 
%recent work on vsi 
One possibility is purely hydrodynamic turbulence through the vertical
shear instability (VSI). The VSI is an axisymmetric linear instability
in three-dimensional (3D) disks in which the rotation frequency
$\Omega$ depends on the height from the disk midplane. The VSI is the
disk analog of the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke instability
\citep[GSF,][]{goldreich67,fricke68} in differentially rotating stars.   
The height-dependence of $\Omega$, or vertical shear, enables
perturbations with large vertical lengthscales (relative to radial
lengthscales) to become unstable.    
\cite{umurhan13} gives a simple explanation for this 
instability: an exchange of fluid parcels while conserving their
angular momenta individually, may result in a new configuration of
lower energy, if the exchange occurs over a sufficiently large
vertical displacement.  

%history 

The VSI has been studied analytically in local approximation
\citep{urpin98,urpin03}. Simulations of the  
VSI have been performed by \cite{arlt04}, and more recently by 
\cite{nelson13}. In these simulations the authors indeed observe the
growth of vertically-global but radially-localized perturbations when
the equilibrium rotation varied with height.  

An important finding from these works is that the VSI requires a short
thermal timescale: perturbations need to be close to
isothermal, unless the disk is neutrally stratified in the vertical
direction. This is because vertical motions are stabilized by
buoyancy if the disk is sub-adiabatically stratified, as required for
convective stability. When the thermal timescale $t_c$ is parametrized
in units of the orbital period $P_\mathrm{orb}$, \cite{nelson13} find that
$t_c\lesssim 0.01P_\mathrm{orb}$ was needed to observe instability. That is, the
temperature profile of the disk essentially remains unchanged during
the disk evolution. This has been confirmed by 
\cite{stoll14}, who find the 
VSI is only sustained in radiation hydrodynamic simulations 
with the inclusion of heating from stellar irradiation.    

%why linear approach? computationally fast (need very high resolution) 
%can be used as a first estimate 

The VSI is sensitive to disk thermodynamics except
in the special case of neutrally stratified disks. It is therefore
important to understand and quantify this dependence, for example on
disk parameters, in order to evaluate the viability of the VSI in
realistic disks. Numerical simulations of the VSI are challenging,
however, because global disk simulations should be carried out while
resolving radial scales much smaller than the local disk scale height.   

On the other hand, should a given disk be
unstable to the VSI, it must pass through the linear instability
first. Thus, studying the thermodynamic dependence of the linear VSI
is a useful first step. Furthermore, linear stability calculations are
essential to complement future numerical simulations.  

%what we're doing
In this work we study the linear VSI in radially-local,
vertically-global models of astrophysical disks. We include an energy
equation with a source term that allows the thermodynamic response of
perturbations to be varied smoothly between isothermal and adiabatic. Our
formulation generalizes previous linear calculations of the 
VSI carried out by \cite{nelson13} and \cite{mcnally14} which assume
isothermal perturbations. Our models are also an extension of early
analysis of \cite{urpin98} and \cite{urpin03} who consider
vertically-localized disturbances. Our vertically-global approach is
necessary to study disturbances with vertical wavelengths
comparable to or larger than the disk scale height. Such disturbances were 
found by \cite{nelson13} to dominate their numerical simulations. 
We thus focus on vertically-global perturbations. 

%paper organization 

%say "grossly simplified 

This paper is organized as follows. In \S\ref{setup} we list the
governing equations and global equilibrium disk models under
consideration. We formulate the linear stability problem in
\S\ref{linear} and simplify it by making the radially-local
approximation. We study the linear problem using two approaches. In
\S\ref{analytical} we present an analytical discussion of vertically
isothermal disks. Our treatment is grossly simplified owing to a
number of approximations made, but closely parallels previous work and 
allows us to highlight the essential effects of vertical shear. In
particular, we quantify a characteristic thermal timescale below which
the VSI is expected to operate. In \S\ref{numerical} we numerically
solve the linearized fluid equations in the radially-local
approximation, but relax all other assumptions made in our analytical approach.   
We find basic agreement with our analysis, including
the aforementioned characteristic thermal timescale. In
\S\ref{application} we apply our linear models to the Minimum Mass
Solar Nebulae (MMSN) and find that the VSI may operate in the outer
parts of the MMSN. We summarize and discuss our results in
\S\ref{summary}, including caveats and possible directions for future
work.
