\section{Application to protoplanetary disks}\label{application} 
\emph{I suggest the following edits
\begin{itemize}
\item Instead of starting over again with the full energy equation focus on giving a phyiscal values for $\Lambda$ and $t_c$ already introduced.
\item Don't describe what we don't do, especially at the outset.  Say what's done, and then if essential list caveats.
\end{itemize}


As an application of our linear models, we estimate where in a
PPD do the thermodynamic conditions allow the VSI to
operate. For a realistic disk one might consider an energy equation
with radiative cooling, 
\begin{align}\label{real_energy}
  % \rho T \frac{DS}{Dt} = - \left(\nabla\cdot\bm{F} - Q_+\right), 
  \frac{\p P}{\p t} + \bm{v}\cdot\nabla P +\gamma P \nabla\cdot\bm{v} = - \frac{P}{\rho T
    C_v}\left(\nabla\cdot\bm{F} - Q_+\right), 
\end{align}
where $C_v$ is the heat capacity at constant
volume, 
$\bm{F}$ is the radiative flux and $Q_+$ is a heating
term to permit an equilibrium solution. 

One should now model in detail each of the terms on the RHS of
Eq. \ref{real_energy}, linearize them, then solve 
the resulting linear eigenvalue problem. This is beyond 
the scope of the present work. Here, we take the simpler approach of
representing the linearized RHS of Eq. \ref{real_energy} by a thermal
relaxation time $t_c$. To do so, we first consider separately
perturbations with radial lengthscales $l\gg l_\mathrm{rad}$ and  
$l\ll l_\mathrm{rad}$, where      
\begin{align}\label{lrad}
  l_\mathrm{rad} \equiv \frac{1}{\kappa_d\rho} 
\end{align} 
is the photon mean-free-path and $\kappa_d$ is the (dust) opacity. 

\subsection{Radiative diffusion}
\emph{the following sentence is too long and has a dangling "this".}

For perturbations with lengthscales $l\gg
l_\mathrm{rad}$, we assume temperature fluctuations are smoothed out
by radiative diffusion and model this in linear theory by writing the
linearized RHS of Eq. \ref{real_energy} as 

\emph{I would have this be an equation for something, like $\Gamma$ or $t_c$.}
\begin{align}\label{diff_cool_proper}
  \frac{P}{\rho T C_v} \nabla\cdot\left(k_\mathrm{rad}\nabla\delta
    T\right),  
\end{align}
where $k_\mathrm{rad}$ is the conduction coefficient to be defined
implicitly. 

\emph{To get to the point more directly and intuitively, I would start below with "We include only the radial derivatives in Eq.\ blah, neglecting vertical derivatives.  This approximation is valid for the vertically elongated modes we consider."  I think we've already discussed vertical elongation enough that this can be brief.  Then maybe say that keeping the vertical derivates would be bad, if you really want to.  "With this simplification (give revised equation)}

However, Eq. \ref{diff_cool_proper} fundamentally changes the linear
problem by introducing higher order derivatives. We defer a proper
analysis of this problem to a follow-up study. Here, we are interested
in order-of-magnitude estimates for perturbations with radial
lengthscales much smaller than vertical lengthscales. We thus proceed 
by assuming vertical derivatives can be neglected in 
Eq. \ref{diff_cool_proper} and write  
\begin{align}\label{diff_cool_approx}
  \frac{P}{\rho T C_v} \nabla\cdot\left(k_\mathrm{rad}\nabla\delta
    T\right) &\to -\frac{k_\mathrm{rad}}{\rho
    C_v}k_x^2P\left(\frac{\delta T}{T}\right)\notag\\
  &\equiv -\eta k_x^2 \left(\delta P - \frac{P}{\rho}\delta\rho\right), 
\end{align}
\citepalias[see also][]{barker15} where $\eta=k_\mathrm{rad}/\rho C_v$ is
the diffusion coefficient and 
is given in terms of physical disk parameters as 
\begin{align}\label{eta_def}
  \eta = \frac{16\sigma_s T^3}{3\kappa_d\rho^2 C_v}, 
\end{align}
where $\sigma_s$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. 
From Eq. \ref{diff_cool_approx} we identify the scale-dependent thermal relaxation
time for diffusion as 
\begin{align}\label{tc_diff_cool} 
  t_\mathrm{diff} = \frac{1}{\eta k_x^2}.%\equiv \frac{\OmK^{-1}}{\hat{\eta}\khat^2}, 
\end{align}

\subsection{Newtonian cooling}\label{newton_cool}
For perturbations with small lengthscales, $l\ll l_\mathrm{rad}$, 
the disk is optically thin.
\emph{the disk isn't (necessarily) opt. thin, the pert. is}
 In this case, we assume 
Newtonian cooling can be applied, which is the thermal
relaxation model as adopted in our linear models. That is, temperature
fluctuations $\delta T$ decay on a timescale $t_\mathrm{cool}$,
independent of $k_x$. For simplicity, we take  
\begin{align}
  t_\mathrm{cool} = \frac{l_\mathrm{rad}^2}{3\eta}. 
\end{align}
We note that $t_\mathrm{cool}$ does not explicitly depend on $\rho$. 

\subsection{A model for combined thermal relaxation}\label{toy_relax}
%To unify $t_\mathrm{cool}$ and $t_\mathrm{diff}$, 
We define the effective thermal relaxation timescale in linear theory as
\begin{align}\label{tc_def}
  t_c &\equiv t_\mathrm{cool} + t _\mathrm{diff}. %=
  % \frac{l_\mathrm{rad}^2}{3\eta} + \frac{1}{\eta k_x^2},  
\end{align}
Eq. \ref{tc_def} is a simple prescription so
that for small scales (large $k_x$), $t_c\to t_\mathrm{cool}$, while
for large scales (small $k_x$), $t_c\to t_\mathrm{diff}$. Writing the
volume density $\rho = \Sigma\hat{\rho}/\sqrt{2\pi}H$, where
$\hat{\rho} = \rho/\rho_0$ and $\Sigma(r)$ is the surface density at the
radius of interest, the dimensionless thermal
relaxation time $\beta$ becomes 
\begin{align}\label{real_beta}
  \beta(r,z;\khat) \equiv t_c\OmK =
  % \frac{1}{\hat{\eta}}\left[\frac{l_\mathrm{rad}^2}{3H^2}
  %   + \frac{\hat{\rho}^2(z)}{2\pi\khat^2}\right]  \simeq
  \frac{\Sigma^2\OmK}{\eta\rho^2}\left[\frac{1}{3\kappa_d^2\Sigma^2} 
    + \frac{\hat{\rho}^2(z)}{2\pi \khat^2}\right].
\end{align}
Note that $\beta$ depends the perturbation lengthscale $\khat$,
distance from the midplane, as well as the distance from the star.  

\subsection{Evaluation for a fiducial disk model}
We evaluate Eq. \ref{real_beta} for the PPD model
described in \cite{chiang10} and summarized in Appendix \ref{mmsn}
(where an opacity model is also chosen). Defining $r_\mathrm{AU}\equiv 
r/\mathrm{AU}$, we find Eq. \ref{real_beta} becomes
\begin{align}\label{beta_mmsn}
  \beta(r, z; \khat) =
  &\frac{4.4\times10^5}{\mu(\gamma-1)}\left(\frac{\hat{\kappa}_d\hat{\Sigma}^2}{\hat{T}}\right)r_\mathrm{AU}^{-57/14}\notag\\ 
&\times\left[\frac{8.3\times10^{-9}}{\hat{\kappa}_d^2\hat{T}^4\hat{\Sigma}^2}r_\mathrm{AU}^{33/7}+\frac{\hat{\rho}^2(z)}{2\pi\khat^2}\right].         
\end{align} 
We refer to the case with $\gamma=1.4$, $\mu=2.33$ and the scalings
$\hat{\Sigma}=\hat{\kappa}_d=\hat{T}=1$ as the Minimum Mass Solar
Nebulae (MMSN) and $\beta=\beta_\mathrm{MMSN}$, 
\begin{align}\label{beta_mmsn_simp}
  \beta_\mathrm{MMSN} = 3.9\times10^{-3} r_\mathrm{AU}^{9/14}\left( 1 +
    1.9\times10^7\hat{\rho}^2r_\mathrm{AU}^{-33/7}\khat^{-2}\right). 
\end{align}
% where
% \begin{align}
%   \
% %  \frac{3.7\times10^{-3}}{\mu\left(\gamma-1\right)\hat{\kappa}_d\hat{T}^5}, 
% \end{align}
% and
% \begin{align}
%   \khat_0 = 4.4\times10^{3}\hat{\kappa}_d\hat{T}^2\hat{\Sigma}.
% \end{align}
It is instructive to compare the above thermal timescale 
with the criterion Eq. \ref{iso_vsi_cond} evaluated for the MMSN,     
\begin{align}\label{bcrit_mmsn}
  % \beta_\mathrm{crit} = \frac{1.44\times10^{-2}}{(\gamma
  % -1)}\left(\frac{\hat{T}}{\mu}\right)^{1/2}r_\mathrm{AU}^{2/7}. 
  \beta_\mathrm{crit,MMSN} = 0.024r_\mathrm{AU}^{2/7}. 
\end{align}

In Fig. \ref{mmsn_bcrit_bcool} we plot Eq. \ref{beta_mmsn}  with $\mu
=2.33$ $\gamma=1.4$, $\hat{T}=\hat{\Sigma}=1$ for opacity scales
$\hat{\kappa}_d=0.1, \,1 $ (MMSN) and $10$, at $z=0$ and $z=3H$. We
also plot Eq. \ref{bcrit_mmsn} in each panel.   

Consider first the MMSN shown in the middle panels of 
Fig. \ref{mmsn_bcrit_bcool}. The critical thermal timescale,
Eq. \ref{bcrit_mmsn}, is useful in the optically thin regime (where the
curves overlap), since in this limit $\beta$ does not depend on
height, as assumed in our analysis. We thus infer that the VSI can
operate at tens of AU in the MMSN.  

In the inner few AU of the MMSN, however, $\beta$ 
may be smaller or greater than $\beta_\mathrm{crit}$ depending on
$z$ as the disk transitions from an optically thick midplane to an
optically thin atmosphere (see also Fig. \ref{bcrit_mmsn2d}). 
%Given a fixed $\khat$, one can have $\beta > \beta_\mathrm{crit}$ at
%the optically thick midplane, but with increasing height the disk 
%becomes optically thin and $\beta<\beta_\mathrm{crit}$. 
Our analytical criteria $\beta < \beta_\mathrm{crit}$ is not valid for
vertically non-uniform $\beta$, and we must turn to numerical
solutions of the linear problem to determine whether or not the VSI
operates. We do this in the next section.    
 
Lowering the opacity, as shown in the top panels of
Fig. \ref{mmsn_bcrit_bcool}, shifts the curves inwards but also raises
them. In fact, lowering the opacity by an order of magnitude renders  
$\beta > \beta_\mathrm{crit}$ even away from the midplane. This is 
expected to stabilize the disk. Raising the opacity, as shown in 
the lower panels of Fig. \ref{mmsn_bcrit_bcool}, decreases the thermal
timescales, but shifts the curves outward, so the instability is
restricted to larger radii.

    The solid line is the 
    critical thermal relaxation timescale $\beta_\mathrm{crit}$.  
    \label{mmsn_bcrit_bcool}}   
\end{figure*}  

We remark that it is possible to satisfy $\beta < \beta_\mathrm{crit}$ 
for sufficiently large $\khat$. We illustrate this in 
Fig. \ref{mmsn_bcrit_bcool_mink} by plotting at each radius the value
of $\khat$ such that $\beta = \beta_\mathrm{crit}$. If we consider the
midplane of the inner disk, say $r\sim 1$AU, the VSI would only occur
on very small radial lengthscales $\ll O(10^{-2}H)$. In the disk
atmosphere where $\beta$ is small, surface modes may develop, 
%However, at such
%small scales, surface modes are likely to dominate (and are
%restricted to the disk atmosphere), 
but they are not well-defined in vertically isothermal disk models
with an imposed boundary, and they also require large $\khat$.    

%surface modes can develop for large $\khat$, 
%which have small vertical lengthscales scales. 
%also small vertical scales if they are surface modes 

However, disturbances with large $\khat$ may be subject to viscous
decay in a real disk. Adopting the standard precription for the
kinematic viscosity $\nu = \alpha c_s H$ \citep{shakura73}, where
$\alpha$ is the dimensionless viscosity parameter, 
the viscous timescale for a perturbation lengthscale 
$l\sim 1/k_x$ is $t_\mathrm{visc} = 1/\alpha\khat^2\Omega $. 
Setting $t_\mathrm{visc}$ to be longer than the
minimum VSI growth timescale $1/h\Omega$ implies 
$\khat^2\lesssim h/\alpha$. Inserting $h \sim 0.05$,
we find only modes with $\khat\lesssim 20$ are relevant for
$\alpha\sim 10^{-4}$ or $\khat\lesssim 70$ for $\alpha\sim
10^{-5}$. \citepalias[These low viscosity levels are required for the
VSI, see][]{nelson13}.

    \label{mmsn_bcrit_bcool_mink}}   
\end{figure}  

\subsection{VSI in the MMSN}
Here we solve the linear stability problem in the MMSN with the scale and
height dependent thermal relaxation timescale given by
Eq. \ref{beta_mmsn_simp}.  Fig. \ref{beta_compare} show examples of
the thermal timescales at $r=5$AU and $r=50$AU for a
perturbation wavenumber $\khat=30$. We also plot the 
corresponding critical thermal timescales evaluated for the MMSN
(Eq. \ref{bcrit_mmsn}).  
 \begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth,clip=true,trim=0cm 0cm 0cm
  0cm]{figures/beta_compare}
  \caption{Thermal relaxation timescales in the MMSN at $r=50$AU
    and $r=5$AU for $\khat=30$ (solid lines). The
    corresponding horizontal dashed lines are the critical thermal
    relaxation timescales derived in linear theory. 
    \label{beta_compare}}
\end{figure}

The outer disk ($r=50$AU) is optically thin,
$\beta<\beta_\mathrm{crit}$  and  does not depend on height.
Accordingly we expect, and find, the VSI operates at $r=50$AU. The
inner disk ($r=5$AU) is optically thick near the midplane but becomes
optically thin away from it, such that $\beta < \beta_\mathrm{crit}$
for $|z|\gtrsim1.25H$. In fact, we also find the VSI in this case, but
with much reduced growth rates (when scaled by the local rotation), as
described below.     

In Fig. \ref{mmsn_overall} we plot characteristic growth timescales
$t_\mathrm{grow} \equiv 1/\sigma$ of the fundamental mode with a range of
wavenumbers, in units of the local orbital time $P_\mathrm{orb}\equiv
2\pi/\OmK$. In fact, we either only find the fundamental mode, or 
that it is the most unstable, except for the appearance of some 
surface modes for large wavenumbers $\khat\gtrsim 50$, which are 
boundary-dependent.  
%However, surface modes are dependent on
%boundary conditions in a vertically isothermal disk \citep{barker15},  
%and 
Disturbances with large $\khat$ are also more likely subject to viscous 
decay, as discussed above. 


% It is also unclear if surface modes are
% dynamically important given they are concentrated in the disk
% atmosphere where the density is small. 
% The dominance of the fundamental mode is also
% observed in hydrodynamic simulations of \cite{stoll14} which treat
% radiative cooling properly.   unclear if surface modes are
% dynamically important because the there is little mass in the disk at

We therefore consider Fig. \ref{mmsn_overall} as a representation of the
VSI in outer parts of the MMSN. We see the VSI operates from $\sim 5$AU to $\sim
50$AU with growth timescales $\sim 30$---40 orbits and
$t_\mathrm{grow}$ rises rapidly towards the inner disk. It is
necessary to consider smaller scales with decreasing $r$ as the disk
generally becomes optically thick.  

The fact that we obtain the VSI in the inner disk despite $\beta >
\beta_\mathrm{crit}$ near the midplane suggests that the instability
can operate provided $\beta < \beta_\mathrm{crit}$ for a sufficiently large
fraction of the vertical domain. However, the normalized growth times
become much longer. For example, for $\khat=30$ we find
$t_\mathrm{grow}\sim 40$ orbits at $r=50$AU, but $t_\mathrm{grow}\sim
400$ orbits at $r=5$AU. Thus, introducing an optically thick midplane
significantly reduces the efficiency of the VSI despite $\beta <
\beta_\mathrm{crit}$ away from the midplane. 

%surface modes may develop for large kx, they are not affected 

We thus find Fig. \ref{mmsn_overall} to be roughly consistent with
comparing the midplane thermal relaxation timescales to the critical
thermal timescale. For example, 
Fig. \ref{mmsn_bcrit_bcool} show that $\beta(z=0,\khat=10) \gtrsim
\beta_\mathrm{crit}$ for $r\lesssim 10$AU in the MMSN (left middle
panel); and Fig. \ref{mmsn_overall} 
show that modes with $\khat=10$ are stabilized inside $\sim 8$AU (where
$t_\mathrm{grow}\to\infty$). Our numerical results suggest the VSI
is efficient at radii of few tens of AU in the MMSN, consistent with
estimates made by \citetalias{nelson13}.
